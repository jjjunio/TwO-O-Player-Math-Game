# Create a 2-Player math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

# Tasks

# ---------- Task 1: Extract Nouns for Classes -----------

# game
# math (addition) problems
# player

# ---------- Task 2: Write their roles--------------------

# What is the role for each class?

# What information is relevant to each class?
# What will they need in order to be initialized?
# What public methods will be defined on them?

# -- Remember that objects are important for two things: --

# State: Storing data describing themselves (variables)
# States track attributes for individual objects. 

# Behavior: Defining actions that can be performed on them (methods)
# Behaviors are what objects are capable of doing.

# ----------------------------------------------------------

# ############################## Game ##############################

# State: The game will store information on whose turn it is and the winner.
# Behavior: Switching between players' turn and identifying the winner. 
# Initialize: player_turn, winner
# Method(s): first_turn, declare_winner

# ######################### Math Problems #########################

# State: Generate random math questions
# Behavior: Will evaluate if the input(answer) is correct
# Initialize: two numbers between 1-20
# Method(s): random_question_generator, correct_answer?

# ############################## Player ##############################

# State: Will store information on player ID, name, lives, total score.
# Behavior: Will be able to change and show players' scores(increase) and lives(decrease). 
# Initialize: ID, name, score, lives
# Method(s): lose_life, add_point

# Furthermore:

# Which class will contain the game loop (where each instance of the loop is the other players turn)?
# Game class 

# Which class should manage who the current_player is?
# Game class

# Which class(es) will contain user I/O and which will not have any?
# Math Problems and Player
